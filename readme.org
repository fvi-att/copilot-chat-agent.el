#+TITLE: Copilot Chat for Emacs with Agent Mode
#+AUTHOR: fvi-att (for agent-mode) Cédric Chépied (for

* Description
This plugin allows you to chat with GitHub copilot with Agent mode.
This feature is still WORKING IN PROGRESS.

Feel free to contribute, report issues or discuss new features.

* News
** Copilot-Vision
When using =gpt-4o= model, you can now send images to Copilot. Open it in emacs and add the buffer to the context like any other one.

** Help wanted
Bug reports and new ideas are very welcome.


* Tips

Many of you won't read this readme. And many of those who start to read won't read more than a few lines. So I'll write some tips here, at the beginning.

** Yank
When using the org frontend, you can yank code blocks provided by Copilot just as you would use the kill ring. Here's a simple configuration:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package copilot-chat
  …
  :bind (:map global-map
            ("C-c C-y" . copilot-chat-yank)
            ("C-c M-y" . copilot-chat-yank-pop)
            ("C-c C-M-y" . (lambda () (interactive) (copilot-chat-yank-pop -1))))
  …)
#+end_src

** Find input section
In copilot-chat buffer, you can use (or bind to a key) the interactive ~copilot-chat-goto-input~ function to place point at the beginning of the prompt area.

** Start new instance
Calling ~copilot-chat-display~ with prefix argument will let you choose instance or create a new one.

** Save instance
You can use ~copilot-chat-save~ and ~copilot-chat-load~ to save/restore a chat with its history.

* Installation
** Melpa
Copilot-chat is available on melpa :

#+begin_example
M-x package-install RET copilot-chat RET
#+end_example

With =use-package= :
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package copilot-chat)

#+end_src

** Straight
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package copilot-chat
  :straight (:host github :repo "chep/copilot-chat.el" :files ("*.el"))
  :after (request org markdown-mode))
#+end_src

** Manual
Clone repository and eval files in emacs.

* Configuration
** GitHub
You will need a GitHub account with access to copilot API. When sending the first prompt, you will need to authenticate to GitHub. Follow instructions and everything will be fine.

** Backend
~copilot-chat-backend~ can be set to ~'curl~ (default) or ~'request~.

With curl, answers will be written token by token. Curl path can be set with `copilot-chat-curl-program` variable.
With request library, the text is written when all data is read and this can be long.

** Frontend
Several frontends are available. You can select your favorite one by setting the ~copilot-chat-frontend~ variable to ~'org~ (default), ~'markdown~ or ~'shell-maker~.

Try them and choose wisely.

** Magit commits
You can use copilot to generate your commit messages :

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'git-commit-setup-hook 'copilot-chat-insert-commit-message)
#+end_src

Or call manually ~(copilot-chat-insert-commit-message)~ when in the commit message buffer.

** Proxy
The proxy can be configured with the curl backend. For the emacs-request backend, please refer to the emacs-request documentation if you need to configure a proxy.

Use the variables ~copilot-chat-curl-proxy~, ~copilot-chat-curl-proxy-user-pass~, and ~copilot-chat-curl-proxy-insecure~ to set up a proxy. Refer to the documentation for each variable to learn how to use them.

Proxies have not been thoroughly tested yet, so there may be bugs. Many options are missing for HTTPS proxies. Please open an issue if you need additional features.

* Usage
** Basic
Start chatting with ~(copilot-chat-display)~ (alias ~(copilot-chat)~). Type your question in prompt, then press ~C-c C-c~ or ~C-c RET~.
You may need to authenticate to GitHub. Follow instructions.

You can select buffers that will be added as context in your prompt. Use ~copilot-chat-add-current-buffer~ and ~copilot-chat-del-current-buffer~. You can also manage buffers by using ~(copilot-chat-list)~. In the list, selected buffer will be highlighted using ~copilot-chat-list-selected-buffer-face~ which inherit from ~font-lock-keyword-face~.

Selected buffers will be sent with each prompt until you remove them.

** Transient
You can call ~(copilot-chat-transient)~ to open transient menu. Almost all functions are accessible.

** Agent Mode
Agent Mode allows Copilot to automatically execute shell commands suggested in its responses. This feature includes safety mechanisms to prevent dangerous operations.

*** Enabling Agent Mode
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Enable agent mode
(copilot-chat-agent-mode-enable)

;; Or toggle agent mode
(copilot-chat-agent-mode-toggle)

;; Check if agent mode is enabled
(copilot-chat-agent-mode-p)
#+end_src

*** Auto-run Levels
Set the auto-execution level based on your security preferences:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Set auto-run level (interactive)
(copilot-chat-agent-set-auto-run-level 'read-only)

;; Or set via customization
(setq copilot-chat-agent-auto-run-level 'safe)
#+end_src

Available levels:
- ~none~ - No automatic execution (manual confirmation required)
- ~read-only~ - Only safe read commands (~ls~, ~cat~, ~git status~, etc.)
- ~safe~ - Safe commands that don't destroy files (~mkdir~, ~touch~, ~git add~, etc.)
- ~write~ - Commands that can modify files (with restrictions)
- ~all~ - All commands except explicitly forbidden ones (dangerous, not recommended)

*** Using Agent Mode
1. Enable agent mode: ~(copilot-chat-agent-mode-enable)~
2. Set desired auto-run level: ~(copilot-chat-agent-set-auto-run-level 'read-only)~
3. Ask Copilot to help with tasks that involve shell commands
4. Commands in code blocks will be automatically detected and executed based on your safety level

*** Example Usage
#+begin_example
User: "Show me the current directory contents and create a new directory called 'test'"

Copilot: "I'll help you with that:

```bash
ls -la
mkdir test
ls -la
```
"

With agent mode enabled and level set to 'safe':
- `ls -la` will execute automatically (read-only command)
- `mkdir test` will execute automatically (safe command)
- `ls -la` will execute automatically to show the result
#+end_example

*** Safety Features
- Command classification by safety level
- Path traversal protection
- Forbidden command blacklist
- User confirmation for unsafe operations
- Execution logging and statistics
- Session-based temporary permissions

alias test-safe="emacs -batch -L . -l tests/test-setup.el -l tests/test-copilot-chat-agent-command-classification.el --eval \"(ert-run-tests-batch 'test-command-classification-safe)\""
alias test-complex="emacs -batch -L . -l tests/test-setup.el -l tests/test-copilot-chat-agent-command-classification.el --eval \"(ert-run-tests-batch 'test-command-classification-with-complex-commands)\""
#+end_example

** Test Coverage
The focused test suite covers:
- **Command classification** (~test-copilot-chat-agent-command-classification.el~) - Tests the safety classification of shell commands including:
  - Basic command classification (read-only, safe, write, dangerous, forbidden)
  - Complex commands with pipes and redirects
  - Dangerous patterns detection (sudo, system file writes, etc.)
  - Unknown command handling

*** Available Test Cases
1. ~test-command-classification-read-only~ - Tests read-only commands like ~ls~, ~cat~, ~git status~
2. ~test-command-classification-safe~ - Tests safe commands like ~mkdir~, ~touch~, ~git add~
3. ~test-command-classification-dangerous~ - Tests dangerous commands like ~rm~, ~chmod~, ~curl~
4. ~test-command-classification-unknown~ - Tests handling of unknown/unrecognized commands
5. ~test-command-classification-with-complex-commands~ - Tests complex scenarios with pipes, redirects, and command chains

** Test Setup
The minimal test setup (~test-setup.el~) loads only essential core modules with minimal mocking, ensuring tests run quickly and reliably without external package dependencies.
